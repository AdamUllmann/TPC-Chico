            <h2>Our Projects</h2>
            <p>We take pride in the diverse and innovative projects our members work on. Ranging from web development, robotics, data analysis, and more, our projects reflect the passion and dedication of our community.</p>

            <!-- Example Project 1 -->
            <article class="project">
                <h3>Cellular Automata 3D</h3>
                <img src="Screenshot Showcasing Graphical Improvements & AA.png" alt="Cellular Automata 3D" />
                <p>A small personal project, simulating the real-time, animated behavior of cellular automata in 3-dimensional space, with user-input rules, camera controls, and speed controls. I also programmed rudimentary ground shadows and shading of the 3D objects, along with antialiasing, frustum culling, and occlusion culling (in progress). The project was heavily inspired by the 2D "Conway's Game of Life" from 1970, which borrowed from the same mathematical concepts. All of this was done with a low-level C graphics library called Raylib. The simulation can handle up to 125,000 cells (cubes) in each frame, at 60 frames per second on modern machines. I am proud of this performance.</p>

                <h3>Raylib Digital Synthesizer</h3>
                <img src="path_to_image_of_project2.jpg" alt="Raylib Digital Synthesizer" />
                <p>A digital synthesizer application for personal use. The program features 6-voice polyphony with 5 different waveform oscillator types: Sine, Saw, Square, Triangle, and Noise. The program also features low-pass and high-pass filters with cutoff and resonance controls. Other additions include tuning functionality, note-to-frequency mapping for keyboard input, and a built-in oscilloscope. All of this was implemented exclusively using the tools of raw Digital Signal Processing and Raylib.</p>
